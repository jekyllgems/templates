# Templates by `jekyllgems`

This is a pinned repo to make it easier to locate themes and templates created for the jekyllgems org. If anything has issues or isn't working correctly please let me know in github Issues for the project itself. All of these are using [Bootstrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Font Awesome Icons v6.4.0](https://fontawesome.com). I will update this file as new themes are added. You can view the changelog for the org at https://changelog.jekyllgems.dev which details changes done on each theme and plugin. You can also procide feedback on our discord channel linked in the README on the front page.

## [Base v0.0.1](https://github.com/jekyllgems/base)

This is just the bare bones Jekyll site. I update this periodically to add more posts. gh-pages doesn't allow many plugins so I only keep the bare minimum theme here so you can install it and use it in beginning jekyll sites instead of the crappy minima theme.

## [Starter Template v0.0.1](https://github.com/jekyllgems/bs5)

This is just the bare bones Jekyll site using Bootstrap v5.3 it is the starter template you can find in simple html on https://getbootstrap.com made into a jekyll theme by adding posts and blog etc. You can download it or use it as a template.
